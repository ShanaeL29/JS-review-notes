Differences Between JSX and HTML

/*
    Although JSX looks a lot like HTML, it has a few key differences. In this lesson we'll see some of the features and syntax that set JSX apart from HTML, and learn to avoid a few "gotchas" that might trip you up.

class --> needs to be className in JSX

event handlers need to be camelCase

For inputs we normally (HTML) would do something like this if you want to associate a label with an input:
    <label for="email">Email</label>
    <input id="email" />
In REACT we would need to do:
    <label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
    <input id="email" />

In JSX EVERY tag needs to be closed </ > no self closing < > in JSX

In JSX every tag can be self-closing. If you want an empty/childless div you can just do <div/> instead of writing it out longhand like <div></div>

single line comments {/* single line JSX comment */}

multi-line comments 
    {
        // 
    }

Be sure to always keep an eye on the console and fix any visible warnings
